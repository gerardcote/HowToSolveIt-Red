# HowToSolveIt-Red
Learning Red from Algorithms implementation using Red and Red/System (based on How to solve it by computer)
Update: Will also try to learn and design solutions using OO-Thinking as an alternative to procedural programming
and maybe sometimes mixing some functional programming too.
Chatting with Claude.ai will be of some help to help learn and create good solutions for helping others to learn too 
from what I will discover from this long journey. Thais has already proved useful even if at this date many errors
are left to detect and correct by human means, until it becomes abvle to correctly learn from real Red or Rebol code.
For now it knows a bit about them but is not aware of many of these languages subtleties ...
