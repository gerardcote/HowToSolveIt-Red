# HowToSolveIt-Red
Learning Red from Algorithms implementation using Red and Red/System (based on How to solve it by computer)

Update: Will also try to learn and design solutions using OO-Thinking as an alternative to procedural programming
and maybe sometimes mixing some functional programming too.

Chatting with Claude.ai will be of some help to help learn and create good solutions for helping others to learn too 
from what I will discover from this long journey. Tais has already proved useful to me for some discovery aspects even if 
at this day many errors are left to detect and correct by human means, until it becomes able to correctly learn from real 
Red or Rebol code. For now it knows a bit about them but is not aware of many of these languages subtleties ...
